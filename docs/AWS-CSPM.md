## **Overview**
This documentation provides details on implementing a security posture management system for AWS using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), automated scanning, real-time monitoring, compliance automation, and Kubernetes security policies.

## **1. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with Terraform**
... (No content change, only heading modification for linking in the table of contents)

## **8. CI/CD Pipeline**
- **CI/CD for Terraform & Policy Checks:**
  - GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD pipelines automatically run Terraform plan/apply and Checkov security scans.
  - Cloud Custodian policies are triggered at scheduled intervals.
  - Alerts for misconfigurations are sent via Slack webhook.
- **Example GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`):**
  ```yaml
  name: Terraform CI/CD
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
  jobs:
    terraform:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Setup Terraform
          uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
        - name: Terraform Init
          run: terraform init
        - name: Terraform Plan
          run: terraform plan
        - name: Terraform Apply
          if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
          run: terraform apply -auto-approve
  ```

## **9. Testing and Validation**
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Deploy small, free-tier resources to validate misconfigurations are detected.
  - Validate Terraform security scanning with Checkov.
  - Ensure AWS Security Hub alerts are triggered for non-compliant resources.
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Use Terraform `validate` and `plan` commands in CI/CD.
  - Introduce intentional misconfigurations and verify remediation actions.

---

## **10. next steps in consideration to add**
- Expand Cloud Custodian rules for cost management and tagging enforcement.
- Integrate more Terraform security policies.
- Refine real-time alerts with AWS Lambda functions.
- Enhance Kubernetes security policies with OPA.
